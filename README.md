# San Diego Veterans Coalition
San Diego Veterans Coalition (SDVC) is a non-profit Veteran Service Organization (VSO) that connects Veterans with other VSOs in the Greater San Diego area in effort to get the Veteran the help that they need with specific situations.  

- Many VSOs are unable to make their name and services known to Veterans because they don't have the manning or simply lack the resources.  This is a disservice to the VSO, as well as Veterans because many of these VSOs have very specialized skills and services that they can provide to Veterans at little-to-no cost!  This is where SDVC comes in.  When a Veteran or Service-member reaches out to SDVC with a problem, SDVC picks a VSO from their network and connects the Veteran with a VSO that will best meet their needs.

- This project consists of a rebuild of the SDVC website and the addition of a web application that will assist SDVC in streamlining their services.  In addition, this rebuild will allow SDVC to track its services more accurately which will, in turn, lead to greater funding.

This project has a back-end using C#/ASP.NET and a front-end using React.js.  Currently, only the web-assistant has been completed using hard-coded data.  The site itself will be a social media site connecting Veterans with VSOs.  This project will be evolving as work continues with SDVC.
